# RestoFinder

This application queries the OpenTable API and returns a filterable list of available restaurants in a specific city.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

The Redux Toolkit is now the recommended approach for implementing Redux in a React application. It includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

If you have not worked with it before it will likely look very different than your standard redux implementation.
